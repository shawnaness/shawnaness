        <p>This project began as the Development assignment for CSCI 1300: User
        Interfaces and User Experiences. The task was to use React.js to build a
        live filtering and sorting page for any content of our choosing.</p>
        <p>As a huge Marvel fan, I thought this was the perfect opportunity to build
        something to help me keep my Marvel facts straight. With 17 movies and counting,
        it's becoming increasingly more difficult to keep track of the timeline
        and characters. This project aims to provide a simple and interactive
        solution to this problem.</p>

          <p>Marvel Madness was coded entirely in React. I took advantage
          of React Components to create a page that was modular in its design.
          Each movie card is its own React Component, as is the entire list
          which displays them.</p>
          <p>All of the data about each movie is hard coded in as a json file.</p>

          </div>
          <p>Here you can see a previous iteration of the design. I originally had a
          very large header that took up a lot of real estate on the screen, as well as
          only one movie card per row. This led to poor usability for several reasons.
          Users not only have to scroll to see more content, but they also have to
          scroll simply to even see the options available to them.</p>
          <p>To fix this, I used CSS flexbox to allow two movie cards per row,
          allowing users to see more content at one time. I chose to keep the options
          bar on the side of the screen because I thought this was the most visually
          appealing layout; however, I did reduce the size of the header by removing
          the superfluous description, which wasn't really adding to the usability
          of the page.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="two column stackable row">
        <div class="ui stackable middle aligned horizontally padded vertically padded mobile reversed grid">
          <div class="eight wide column">
            <div class="ui center aligned container">
              <i class="violet large options icon"></i>
            </div>
            <p>By far the most difficult design challenge was the layout of the
            options bar. I decided quite early on that I wanted to use superhero logos
            as the "checkboxes" for selecting movies containing a given superhero, rather
            than simple checkboxes or dropdowns. However, this led to an interesting
            problem, as the layout of these must be carefully considered.</p>
            <p>I decided to place these logos to the side of the main content of the
            page, rather than at the top. The superhero logos looked best when in
            a 3x3 grid or stacked vertically rather than spread horizontally. This meant
            sacrificing some usability for visual design, since users now have to scroll
            in order to view all of the filtering options available to them. However,
            I believe this trade-off is well worth it, as this superhero logo grid
            helps create a comic book aesthetic for the entire page.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="eight wide column">
            <img class="ui small centered image" src="images/marvel-3.PNG" >

      <div class="one column row">
        <div class="column">
          <div class="ui center aligned container">
            <i class="violet large checkmark icon"></i>
          </div>
          <p>This project was incredibly rewarding. I gained a lot of experience
          with React.js, and I loved getting to build something related to the
          superhero movies that I love. It was also interesting for me to consider
          the visual design and usability tradeoffs due to my design decisions.
          I plan to continue improving this project, considering ways to improve
          the usability of the options bar and adding movies as Marvel continues
          to churn them out.</p>
